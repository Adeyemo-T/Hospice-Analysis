## Project Background

A **Hospice Facility in the United States** is currently facing the operational challenge of **high patient readmission rates**. This issue directly threatens the facility's ability to access critical funding, which is essential for maintaining and improving overall operational efficiency and patient care quality.

This project thoroughly analyzes the facility's clinical and demographic data to uncover the root causes of high readmission rates and support data-driven decision-making.

The analysis delivers actionable insights focused on the following key areas:

* **Care Performance Evaluation:** A deep dive into core metrics like **Readmission Rate**, **Discharge Efficiency**, and **Average Length of Care** to benchmark performance.
* **Patient Profile Segmentation:** Analysis of **patient demographics (age, gender)** and **Top ICD-10 Diagnoses** to identify high-risk patient groups.
* **Care Flow Analysis:** An evaluation of how patients exit care (discharged vs. died) and the factors that influence the total time patients remain in the care program.
